{"IedrkI1l4RPVtQaL":{"id":"IedrkI1l4RPVtQaL","type":"file","name":"Welcome file","parentId":null,"hash":-585715289,"tx":1},"IedrkI1l4RPVtQaL/content":{"id":"IedrkI1l4RPVtQaL/content","type":"content","text":"# Welcome to StackEdit!\n\nHi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.\n\n\n# Files\n\nStackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**\n\n## Create files and folders\n\nThe file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.\n\n## Switch to another file\n\nAll your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.\n\n## Rename a file\n\nYou can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the **Rename** button in the file explorer.\n\n## Delete a file\n\nYou can delete the current file by clicking the **Remove** button in the file explorer. The file will be moved into the **Trash** folder and automatically deleted after 7 days of inactivity.\n\n## Export a file\n\nYou can export the current file by clicking **Export to disk** in the menu. You can choose to export the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars template or as a PDF.\n\n\n# Synchronization\n\nSynchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your **Google Drive**, your **Dropbox** and your **GitHub** accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.\n\nThere are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:\n\n- The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.\n\t> To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.\n\n- The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub**.\n\t> Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the **Synchronize** sub-menu.\n\n## Open a file\n\nYou can open a file from **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Open from**. Once opened in the workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.\n\n## Save a file\n\nYou can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.\n\n## Synchronize a file\n\nOnce your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.\n\nIf you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the **Synchronize now** button in the navigation bar.\n\n> **Note:** The **Synchronize now** button is disabled if you have no file to synchronize.\n\n## Manage file synchronization\n\nSince one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking **File synchronization** in the **Synchronize** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.\n\n\n# Publication\n\nPublishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you're happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms like **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **WordPress** and **Zendesk**. With [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/), you have full control over what you export.\n\n> Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the **Publish** sub-menu.\n\n## Publish a File\n\nYou can publish your file by opening the **Publish** sub-menu and by clicking **Publish to**. For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:\n\n- Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),\n- HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).\n\n## Update a publication\n\nAfter publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to re-publish it. Once you have modified your file and you want to update your publication, click on the **Publish now** button in the navigation bar.\n\n> **Note:** The **Publish now** button is disabled if your file has not been published yet.\n\n## Manage file publication\n\nSince one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking **File publication** in the **Publish** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove publication locations that are linked to your file.\n\n\n# Markdown extensions\n\nStackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra **Markdown extensions**, providing you with some nice features.\n\n> **ProTip:** You can disable any **Markdown extension** in the **File properties** dialog.\n\n\n## SmartyPants\n\nSmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into \"smart\" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:\n\n|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |\n|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |\n|Quotes          |`\"Isn't this fun?\"`            |\"Isn't this fun?\"            |\n|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|\n\n\n## KaTeX\n\nYou can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):\n\nThe *Gamma function* satisfying $\\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\\quad\\forall n\\in\\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral\n\n$$\n\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\\,.\n$$\n\n> You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).\n\n\n## UML diagrams\n\nYou can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nAlice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?\nBob-->>John: How about you John?\nBob--x Alice: I am good thanks!\nBob-x John: I am good thanks!\nNote right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.\n\nBob-->Alice: Checking with John...\nAlice->John: Yes... John, how are you?\n```\n\nAnd this will produce a flow chart:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))\nA --> C(Round Rect)\nB --> D{Rhombus}\nC --> D\n```\n","properties":"\n","discussions":{},"comments":{},"hash":-332455363,"tx":1},"IedrkI1l4RPVtQaL/syncedContent":{"id":"IedrkI1l4RPVtQaL/syncedContent","type":"syncedContent","historyData":{},"syncHistory":{},"v":0,"hash":1609618490360,"tx":1},"36EOVcgho5ofV8FD":{"id":"36EOVcgho5ofV8FD","type":"file","name":"GameJolt","parentId":"HoOcd3FJ9trItNA7","hash":422455363,"tx":5},"3j68adYjOFZ1E9OF":{"id":"3j68adYjOFZ1E9OF","type":"file","name":"Intro","parentId":"E2OE5xvFO9W4NPy7","hash":-740964531,"tx":5},"6nHmRJKs6fHCeU00":{"id":"6nHmRJKs6fHCeU00","type":"file","name":"UniMaker -

Search for the icon you want (must be in ``.png``, ``.jpg`` or ``.gif``)\n2. Copy its URL.\n3. Paste it in the **name** bar, then select **open**.\n\n### Changing a title\n\nPut the selector over the application or game you want to modify, then click on the title above its thumbnail.\n\n> **Note:** Titles can only be 32 characters long.\n\n### Removing wallpaper\n\nSelect the option to add a new wallpaper, then in the window that appears select **cancel**, the previous wallpaper will be removed from the launcher.\n\n### Switching between 12h ~ 24h clock\n\nYou can switch between 12 hour clock (AM/PM) and 24 hour clock **by clicking on the text displaying your current time** in the upper-left corner of the interface.\n\n### Locking the interface\n\nIf you hover the cursor over the **clock** 🕓 icon in the upper-left corner of the interface, a **lock** 🔓 icon will appear, by **clicking on it 3 times** the icon will turn pink and the interface will be locked. \nWith the interface locked, the following options will be restricted to any modifications:\n- Applications / games on the library.\n- Current wallpaper.\n- Launcher settings.\n- Clock type.\n\n> **Note:** You can unlock the interface at any time by following the same initial procedure.\n\n### Backuping your data\n\nEach user on your computer has its own profile on Ninty, if you plan to change accounts you can easily back up all your data to be restored later:\n\n1. Open the launcher **settings** ⚙.\n2. Select **profile folder** 📁.\n3. A directory will be opened in your file explorer, here you can copy all your files to a safe place or pack them into a ``.zip`` file.\n\n> **Note:** This will not back up the executables of your applications/games, only the library preferences, time records and personal settings.\n\n### Eletronic Guide\n\n**Ninny** <img alt=\"coursebot\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jLoh5vj.png\" width=\"24\"> is the official assistant of Ninty Launcher and your electronic guide:\n\n- When starting the launcher for the first time, she will give you an overview of the main interface and explain what each option in the launcher settings menu does.\n\n- If allowed, she will notify you of new updates for the launcher.\n\n> **Tip:** You can access the guide at any time in the launcher **settings** ⚙.\n\n##  Troubleshooting\n\n### General solutions\n\nThe following steps can avoid/solve common problems regarding the overall functionality of the launcher:\n\n+ Go to the ``.zip`` file you downloaded containing the launcher, right-click on it and go to ``Properties``, check the ``Unblock`` box and click on the **apply** button, extract the launcher again and then, if possible, run it as **administrator**. This can solve problems regarding permissions.\n\n+ Avoid storing the launcher and its files in directories with special characters in their names (E.g.: ``â,Ñ,ç,&.``). If you are still having trouble when starting the application, try moving it to the main drive, usually ``C\\``. You can also try this for your applications and games installed in your library.\n\n+ If the launcher seems to go into infinite loads or is unable to connnect to the internet, it is likely that your system may be preventing the launcher from using certain features over the network, check your antivirus and firewall settings.\n\n### Specific solutions\n\n• **The interface is visually glitchy for me.**\n> Go into the **settings** ⚙ menu, then switch the **interface rendering** mode.\n\n• **I can't launch anything, but no error message appears.**\n> First, make sure to be using the latest version. If Ninty is downloading something (see if there is a connection icon in the upper-left corner of the interface), you need to wait for this task to finish before starting anything, but if it is taking longer than usual, the launcher may be having trouble to download certain files. this may be due to some imposed by your antivirus or firewall. See the [General solutions](#general-solutions) section.\n\n• **When I try to start a game, it softlocks the launcher.**\n> Try to reinstall the game in the library as a shortcut.\n\n• **When I start a game, the time is not recorded and the launcher is not minimized.**\n> This feature works only with games that have only a single window instance running, for instance, if you are trying to run a game that has its own launcher, sometimes it will not work. Reinstall it in your library as a shortcut instead.\n\n• **Forwarder embeds are not working.**\n> If the application you are using as a forwarder needs a special parameter to execute embeded files, it will not work with Ninty. But if the application does not need a special parameter, the problem may be related to permissions, See the [General solutions](#general-solutions) section.\n\n• **Rich presence is not working with some games.**\n> If the game you launched has its own rich presence, it will always override the default one. For shortcuts, Ninty will not change the status.\n\n• **I updated Ninty, but the launcher is crashing when I try to start it.**\n> Close the launcher, open you file explorer, in the address bar type: ``%localappdata%\\Ninty_Launcher``, go to this directory and delete all existing files except the ``collection`` folder, then open Ninty again. \n\n## Customization Guide\n\n## First Steps\n\nThere are plenty of sample themes included with Ninty that you can use to create your custom wallpapers.\n\nHere are some recommendations that you should take into account:\n\n1. Although there is no specific size, it is recommended to use a **16:9 aspect ratio** (such as ``1280x720px``) for your wallpapers.\n2. **The song file should be in** ``.ogg`` (*Vorbis*)\n\t- I recommend using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to export in this format.\n\t- The file name must be the same as the image file for your wallpaper in order to work, so if your wallpaper is named ``mytheme.png``, the song file should be named ``mytheme.ogg``.\n3. Ninty uses **strip-based animations**, so for all animations, each frame is next to each other in a single file.\n4. **Don't make animations too long**, keep in mind that all frames are loaded into memory at once, so very long animations can have a high impact in the performance.\n\n## Reference\n\nHere is a list of the content of the configuration file and how to use its parameters. The file name must be the same as the image file for your wallpaper in order to work, so if your wallpaper is named ``mytheme.png``, the configuration file should be named ``mytheme.ini``.\n\n• **Configuration file** (With default values)\n```ini\n[NINTY_WALLPAPER]\ntheme = \"1\"\nopaquebuttons = \"1\"\ntiled = \"0\"\nstretched = \"0\"\nsmooth = \"1\"\n\nhorizontal_offset = \"0\"\nvertical_offset = \"0\"\n\nhorizontal_scrolling = \"0\"\nvertical_scrolling = \"0\"\n\nanimframes = \"1\"\nanimspeed = \"0\"\n\nhuecolor = \"0\"\ncursor_hue = \"0\"\n\ncursor_luminosityA = \"255\"\ncursor_saturationA = \"255\"\n\ncursor_luminosityB = \"64\"\ncursor_saturationB = \"255\"\n```\n\n• **Parameters description**\n\n**theme** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Sets the interface to **light** theme.\n|``1``|Sets the interface to **dark** theme.\n\n**opaquebuttons** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Makes all icons **translucent**.\n|``1``|Makes all icons **opaque**.\n\n**tiled** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``0``|The wallpaper is displayed in a single spot.\n|``1``|The wallpaper is displayed in tiles (horizontally and vertically).\n\n**stretched** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``0``|The wallpaper is kept in the original proportion.\n|``1``|Stretches the wallpaper to the size of the window.\n> If used, it override the **tiled** parameter.\n\n**smooth** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``0``|No anti-aliasing.\n|``1``|Automatic anti-aliasing, the wallpaper will appear smoother when resized.\n> Ninty will automatically determine the level of anti-aliasing based on your screen resolution.\n\n**horizontal_offset** = ...  \n**vertical_offset** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``Any value``|Initial position of the wallpaper relative to the window (in pixels).\n> You can use negative values as well.\n\n\n**horizontal_scroll** = ...  \n**vertical_scroll** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``Any value``|Scrolling speed of the wallpaper (in pixels).\n> Negative values will make it scroll to the opposite direction.

Um diretório será aberto em seu explorador de arquivos, aqui você pode copiar todos os seus arquivos para um local seguro ou compactá-los em um arquivo ``.zip``.\n\n> **Obs.:** Isso não fará backup dos executáveis de seus aplicativos/jogos, apenas das preferências da biblioteca, registro de tempo e configurações pessoais.\n\n### Guia Eletrônico\n\n**Ninny** <img alt=\"coursebot\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jLoh5vj.png\" width=\"24\">  é a assistente oficial do Ninty Launcher e sua guia:\n\n- Ao iniciar o launcher pela primeira vez, ela lhe dará uma visão geral da interface principal e explicará o que cada opção no menu de configurações do launcher faz.\n\n- Se permitido, ela o notificará sobre novas atualizações para o launcher.\n\n> **Dica:** Você pode acessar a guia a qualquer momento nas **configurações** ⚙ do launcher.\n\n##  Solução de Problemas\n\n### Soluções gerais\n\nOs seguintes passos podem evitar/resolver problemas comuns relacionados ao funcionamento geral do launcher:\n\n+ Vá até o arquivo ``.zip`` que você baixou contendo o launcher, clique com botão direito do mouse sobre o arquivo e vá em ``Propriedades``, marque a caixa ``Desbloquear`` e clique no botão **aplicar**, extraia o launcher novamente e então o execute como **administrador** se possível. Isso pode resolver problemas relacionadas a permissões.\n\n+ Evite armazenar o launcher e seus arquivos em diretórios com caracteres especiais (Ex.: ``â,Ñ,ç,&.``). Se você ainda estiver tendo algum problema com a inicialização do launcher, tente move-lo para o drive principal, geralmente ``C\\``. Você também pode tentar isso para seus aplicativos e jogos instalados em sua biblioteca.\n\n+ Se o launcher parece entrar em carregamentos infinitos ou não conseguir se conectar à internet, é provável que o seu sistema esteja impedindo o launcher de usar certos recursos de rede, verifique as configurações de antivírus e do firewall.\n\n### Soluções específicas\n\n• **A interface esta com bugs visuais para mim.**\n> Vá para o menu **configurações** ⚙ e mude para o modo de **renderização da interface**.\n\n• **Não consigo iniciar nada, mas nenhuma mensagem de erro aparece.**\n> Primeiro, certifique-se de usar a versão mais recente. Se o Ninty estiver baixando algo (veja se há um ícone de conexão no canto superior esquerdo da interface), você precisa esperar que esta tarefa termine antes de iniciar qualquer coisa, mas se estiver demorando mais do que o normal, o launcher pode estar tendo problemas para baixar certos arquivos. isso pode ser devido a algo imposto pelo seu antivírus ou firewall. Veja a seção [Soluções gerais](#soluções-gerais).\n\n• **Quando tento iniciar um jogo, ele trava o launcher.**\n> Tente reinstalar o jogo na biblioteca como um atalho.\n\n• **Quando eu começo um jogo, o tempo não é registrado e o launcher não é minimizado.**\n> Este recurso funciona apenas com jogos que possuem apenas uma única instância de janela em execução, por exemplo, se você estiver tentando executar um jogo que possui seu próprio launcher, às vezes não funcionará. Reinstale-o na sua biblioteca como um atalho.\n\n• **As anexos em forwarder não estão funcionando.**\n> Se o aplicativo que você está usando como forwarder precisa de um parâmetro especial para executar arquivos anexados, ele não funcionará com o Ninty. Mas se o aplicativo não precisa de um parâmetro especial, o problema pode estar relacionado às permissões, consulte a seção [Soluções gerais](#soluções-gerais).\n\n• **Rich presence não está funcionando com alguns jogos.**\n> Se o jogo que você iniciou tiver seu próprio rich presence, ele sempre substituirá o padrão. Para atalhos, o Ninty não mudará o status.\n\n• **Atualizei o Ninty, mas o launcher está fechando / travando quando tento iniciá-lo.**\n> Feche o Ninty Launcher, abra seu explorador de arquivos, na barra de endereço digite: ``%localappdata%\\Ninty_Launcher``, vá para esse diretório e exclua todos os arquivos existentes com exceção da pasta ``collection``, então abra o Ninty novamente.\n\n## Guia de Customização\n\n## Primeiros passos\n\nExistem muitos temas de amostra incluídos no Ninty que você pode usar para criar seus próprios planos de fundos personalizados.\n\nAqui estão algumas recomendações que você deve levar em consideração:\n\n1. Embora não haja um tamanho específico, é recomendável usar **proporção 16:9** (como ``1280x720px``) para seus planos de fundo.\n2. **O arquivo de música deve estar em** ``.ogg`` (*Vorbis*)\n\t- Eu recomendo usar o [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) para exportar para este formato.\n\t- O nome do arquivo deve ser o mesmo que o arquivo de imagem do seu plano de fundo para funcionar, então se o seu plano de fundo se chama ``meutema.png``, o arquivo de música deve se chamar ``meutema.ogg``.\n3. O Ninty usa **animações baseadas em faixas** (Strip), portanto, para todas as animações, cada quadro fica ao lado do outro em um único arquivo.\n4. **Não faça animações muito longas**, lembre-se de que todos os frames são carregados na memória de uma vez, então animações muito longas podem ter um grande impacto no desempenho.\n\n## Referência\n\nAqui está uma lista do conteúdo do arquivo de configuração e como usar seus parâmetros. O nome do arquivo deve ser o mesmo que o arquivo do seu plano de fundo para funcionar, então se o seu plano de fundo se chama ``meutema.png``, o arquivo de configuração deve se chamar ``meutema.ini``.\n\n• **Arquivo de configuração** (Com valores padrões)\n```ini\n[NINTY_WALLPAPER]\ntheme = \"1\"\nopaquebuttons = \"1\"\ntiled = \"0\"\nstretched = \"0\"\nsmooth = \"1\"\n\nhorizontal_offset = \"0\"\nvertical_offset = \"0\"\n\nhorizontal_scrolling = \"0\"\nvertical_scrolling = \"0\"\n\nanimframes = \"1\"\nanimspeed = \"0\"\n\nhuecolor = \"0\"\ncursor_hue = \"0\"\n\ncursor_luminosityA = \"255\"\ncursor_saturationA = \"255\"\n\ncursor_luminosityB = \"64\"\ncursor_saturationB = \"255\"\n```\n\n• **Descrição dos parâmetros**\n\n**theme** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Define a interface para tema **claro**.\n|``1``|Define a interface para tema **escuro**.\n\n**opaquebuttons** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Torna todos os ícones **translúcidos**.\n|``1``|Torna todos os ícones **opacos**.\n\n**tiled** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|O plano de fundo é exibido em um único local.\n|``1``|O plano de fundo é exibido em blocos (horizontal e verticalmente).\n\n**stretched** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|O plano de fundo é mantido na proporção original.\n|``1``|Estende o plano de fundo ao tamanho da janela.\n> Se usado, ele substitui o parâmetro **tiled**.\n\n**smooth** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Sem anti-aliasing.\n|``1``|Com anti-aliasing automático, o plano de fundo aparecerá mais suave quando redimensionado.\n> O Ninty determinará automaticamente o nível de anti-aliasing com base na resolução de sua tela.\n\n**horizontal_offset** = ...  \n**vertical_offset** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``Qualquer valor``|Posição inicial do plano de fundo em relação à janela (em pixels).\n> Você também pode usar valores negativos.\n\n\n**horizontal_scroll** = ...  \n**vertical_scroll** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``Qualquer valor``|Scrolling speed of the wallpaper (in pixels)\n> Valores negativos farão a rolagem ir na direção oposta.

Vá para **Build** > **Create Executable**.\n\n## Overrides\n\n### Redirecionamento da base de dados\n\nVocê pode redirecionar para onde o Ninty busca por miniaturas predefinidas, criando um novo arquivo chamado ``NETWORK.cfg`` no mesmo diretório que o layncher com o seguinte conteúdo:\n```ini\n[REDIRECT]\nappdb = \"X\"\n```\n> **X** é para onde vai o URL do seu arquivo de banco de dados.

Procure pelo ícone que você quer (deve estar em ``.png``, ``.jpg`` ou ``.gif``)\n2. Copie seu URL.\n3. Cole-o na barra de **nome**, selecione **abrir**.\n\n### Alterando um título\n\nColoque o seletor sobre o aplicativo ou jogo que deseja modificar e clique no título acima da miniatura.\n\n> **Obs.:** Os títulos só podem ter até 32 caracteres.\n\n### Removendo plano de fundo\n\nSelecione a opção de adicionar um novo plano de fundo e, na janela que aparecer, selecione **cancelar**, o plano de fundo anterior será removido do launcher.\n\n### Alternando entre relógio 12h ~ 24h\n\nVocê pode alternar entre o relógio de 12 horas (AM/PM) e de 24 horas ao **clicar no texto que exibe sua hora atual** no canto superior esquerdo da interface.\n\n### Bloqueando a interface\n\n\nSe você passar o cursor sobre o ícone do **relógio** 🕓 no canto superior esquerdo da interface, um ícone de **cadeado** 🔓 aparecerá, **clicando nele 3 vezes** o ícone ficará rosa e a interface será bloqueada.\nCom a interface bloqueada, as seguintes opções serão restritas a quaisquer modificações:\n- Aplicativos / jogos na biblioteca.\n- Plano de fundo atual.\n- Configurações do launcher.\n- Tipo de relógio.\n\n> **Obs.:** Você pode desbloquear a interface a qualquer momento, seguindo o mesmo procedimento inicial.\n\n### Fazendo backup dos seus dados\n\nCada usuário em seu computador tem seu próprio perfil no Ninty; se você planeja mudar de conta, você pode facilmente fazer backup de todos os seus dados para serem restaurados posteriormente:\n\n1. Abra as **configurações** ⚙ do launcher.\n2. Selecione **pasta de perfil** 📁.\n3. Um diretório será aberto em seu explorador de arquivos, aqui você pode copiar todos os seus arquivos para um local seguro ou compactá-los em um arquivo ``.zip``.\n\n> **Obs.:** Isso não fará backup dos executáveis de seus aplicativos/jogos, apenas das preferências da biblioteca, registro de tempo e configurações pessoais.\n\n### Guia Eletrônico\n\n**Ninny** <img alt=\"coursebot\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jLoh5vj.png\" width=\"24\">  é a assistente oficial do Ninty Launcher e sua guia:\n\n- Ao iniciar o launcher pela primeira vez, ela lhe dará uma visão geral da interface principal e explicará o que cada opção no menu de configurações do launcher faz.\n\n- Se permitido, ela o notificará sobre novas atualizações para o launcher.\n\n> **Dica:** Você pode acessar a guia a qualquer momento nas **configurações** ⚙ do launcher.\n\n##  Solução de Problemas\n\n### Soluções gerais\n\nOs seguintes passos podem evitar/resolver problemas comuns relacionados ao funcionamento geral do launcher:\n\n+ Vá até o arquivo ``.zip`` que você baixou contendo o launcher, clique com botão direito do mouse sobre o arquivo e vá em ``Propriedades``, marque a caixa ``Desbloquear`` e clique no botão **aplicar**, extraia o launcher novamente e então o execute como **administrador** se possível. Isso pode resolver problemas relacionadas a permissões.\n\n+ Evite armazenar o launcher e seus arquivos em diretórios com caracteres especiais (Ex.: ``â,Ñ,ç,&.``). Se você ainda estiver tendo algum problema com a inicialização do launcher, tente move-lo para o drive principal, geralmente ``C\\``. Você também pode tentar isso para seus aplicativos e jogos instalados em sua biblioteca.\n\n+ Se o launcher parece entrar em carregamentos infinitos ou não conseguir se conectar à internet, é provável que o seu sistema esteja impedindo o launcher de usar certos recursos de rede, verifique as configurações de antivírus e do firewall.\n\n### Soluções específicas\n\n• **A interface esta com bugs visuais para mim.**\n> Vá para o menu **configurações** ⚙ e mude para o modo de **renderização da interface**.\n\n• **Não consigo iniciar nada, mas nenhuma mensagem de erro aparece.**\n> Primeiro, certifique-se de usar a versão mais recente. Se o Ninty estiver baixando algo (veja se há um ícone de conexão no canto superior esquerdo da interface), você precisa esperar que esta tarefa termine antes de iniciar qualquer coisa, mas se estiver demorando mais do que o normal, o launcher pode estar tendo problemas para baixar certos arquivos. isso pode ser devido a algo imposto pelo seu antivírus ou firewall. Veja a seção [Soluções gerais](#soluções-gerais).\n\n• **Quando tento iniciar um jogo, ele trava o launcher.**\n> Tente reinstalar o jogo na biblioteca como um atalho.\n\n• **Quando eu começo um jogo, o tempo não é registrado e o launcher não é minimizado.**\n> Este recurso funciona apenas com jogos que possuem apenas uma única instância de janela em execução, por exemplo, se você estiver tentando executar um jogo que possui seu próprio launcher, às vezes não funcionará. Reinstale-o na sua biblioteca como um atalho.\n\n• **As anexos em forwarder não estão funcionando.**\n> Se o aplicativo que você está usando como forwarder precisa de um parâmetro especial para executar arquivos anexados, ele não funcionará com o Ninty. Mas se o aplicativo não precisa de um parâmetro especial, o problema pode estar relacionado às permissões, consulte a seção [Soluções gerais](#soluções-gerais).\n\n• **Rich presence não está funcionando com alguns jogos.**\n> Se o jogo que você iniciou tiver seu próprio rich presence, ele sempre substituirá o padrão. Para atalhos, o Ninty não mudará o status.\n\n• **Atualizei o Ninty, mas o launcher está fechando / travando quando tento iniciá-lo.**\n> Feche o Ninty Launcher, abra seu explorador de arquivos, na barra de endereço digite: ``%localappdata%\\Ninty_Launcher``, vá para esse diretório e exclua todos os arquivos existentes com exceção da pasta ``collection``, então abra o Ninty novamente.\n\n## Guia de Customização\n\n## Primeiros passos\n\nExistem muitos temas de amostra incluídos no Ninty que você pode usar para criar seus próprios planos de fundos personalizados.\n\nAqui estão algumas recomendações que você deve levar em consideração:\n\n1. Embora não haja um tamanho específico, é recomendável usar **proporção 16:9** (como ``1280x720px``) para seus planos de fundo.\n2. **O arquivo de música deve estar em** ``.ogg`` (*Vorbis*)\n\t- Eu recomendo usar o [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) para exportar para este formato.\n\t- O nome do arquivo deve ser o mesmo que o arquivo de imagem do seu plano de fundo para funcionar, então se o seu plano de fundo se chama ``meutema.png``, o arquivo de música deve se chamar ``meutema.ogg``.\n3. O Ninty usa **animações baseadas em faixas** (Strip), portanto, para todas as animações, cada quadro fica ao lado do outro em um único arquivo.\n4. **Não faça animações muito longas**, lembre-se de que todos os frames são carregados na memória de uma vez, então animações muito longas podem ter um grande impacto no desempenho.\n\n## Referência\n\nAqui está uma lista do conteúdo do arquivo de configuração e como usar seus parâmetros. O nome do arquivo deve ser o mesmo que o arquivo do seu plano de fundo para funcionar, então se o seu plano de fundo se chama ``meutema.png``, o arquivo de configuração deve se chamar ``meutema.ini``.\n\n• **Arquivo de configuração** (Com valores padrões)\n```ini\n[NINTY_WALLPAPER]\ntheme = \"1\"\nopaquebuttons = \"1\"\ntiled = \"0\"\nstretched = \"0\"\nsmooth = \"1\"\n\nhorizontal_offset = \"0\"\nvertical_offset = \"0\"\n\nhorizontal_scrolling = \"0\"\nvertical_scrolling = \"0\"\n\nanimframes = \"1\"\nanimspeed = \"0\"\n\nhuecolor = \"0\"\ncursor_hue = \"0\"\n\ncursor_luminosityA = \"255\"\ncursor_saturationA = \"255\"\n\ncursor_luminosityB = \"64\"\ncursor_saturationB = \"255\"\n```\n\n• **Descrição dos parâmetros**\n\n**theme** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Define a interface para tema **claro**.\n|``1``|Define a interface para tema **escuro**.\n\n**opaquebuttons** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Torna todos os ícones **translúcidos**.\n|``1``|Torna todos os ícones **opacos**.\n\n**tiled** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|O plano de fundo é exibido em um único local.\n|``1``|O plano de fundo é exibido em blocos (horizontal e verticalmente).\n\n**stretched** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|O plano de fundo é mantido na proporção original.\n|``1``|Estende o plano de fundo ao tamanho da janela.\n> Se usado, ele substitui o parâmetro **tiled**.\n\n**smooth** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Sem anti-aliasing.\n|``1``|Com anti-aliasing automático, o plano de fundo aparecerá mais suave quando redimensionado.\n> O Ninty determinará automaticamente o nível de anti-aliasing com base na resolução de sua tela.\n\n**horizontal_offset** = ...  \n**vertical_offset** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``Qualquer valor``|Posição inicial do plano de fundo em relação à janela (em pixels).\n> Você também pode usar valores negativos.\n\n\n**horizontal_scroll** = ...  \n**vertical_scroll** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``Qualquer valor``|Scrolling speed of the wallpaper (in pixels)\n> Valores negativos farão a rolagem ir na direção oposta.

Baixe o repositório.\n\t2. Abra ``/Project/Ninty_Launcher.yyp`` como um projeto.\n\t3. Vá para **Build** > **Create Executable**.\n\n## Overrides\n\n### Redirecionamento da base de dados\n\nVocê pode redirecionar para onde o Ninty busca por miniaturas predefinidas, criando um novo arquivo chamado ``NETWORK.cfg`` no mesmo diretório que o layncher com o seguinte conteúdo:\n```ini\n[REDIRECT]\nappdb = \"X\"\n```\n> **X** é para onde vai o URL do seu arquivo de banco de dados.

Ele substitui todos os dados atualmente carregados no criador de níveis, certifique-se de salvar seu nível atual antes de carregar outro.\n- <img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xov59pV.png\" width=\"16\"> **Imagem** - Gera uma imagem ``.png`` do nível atual. Você pode usá-lo como uma prévia ao compartilhar seu nível.\n\n### 🌐 Carregando níveis da internet\n\nAo carregar níveis, você pode facilmente importá-los diretamente da internet:\n\n1. Selecione a opção para abrir um nível como faria normalmente.\n2. Procure pelo nível que deseja jogar (deve estar em ``.uni`` ou ``.unis``) e copie seu URL.\n3. Cole-o na barra de **nome**, selecione **abrir** e espere até que o nível seja baixado e iniciado automaticamente.\n\n> **Obs.:** Isto não funcionará com níveis compactados em ``.zip``.\n\n### Apagando / colocando elementos no nível\n\n- <img alt=\"place\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Fagzu3F.png\" width=\"16\"> **Colocar**\n\t1. Selecione um elemento no menu **Elementos**.\n\t2. Em seu nível, **clique com o botão esquerdo** para colocar o elemento selecionado em uma área vazia.\n- <img alt=\"erase\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nWj0ZJU.png\" width=\"16\"> **Apagar**\n\t1. Posicione o mouse sobre algum elemento do nível.\n\t2. **Clique com botão direito** para remover esse elemento.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/7zcJYXb.gif)\n\n> **Dica:** Você pode colocar ou apagar vários elementos segurando um dos botões. Você também pode limpar sua seleção atual ao clicar no ícone da **borracha** <img alt=\"eraser\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7NZwbYi.png\" width=\"24\">.\n\n### Colocando itens dentro de blocos\n\n1. Coloque um item e um bloco em uma área vazia separados uns dos outros.\n2. Arraste o item sobre o bloco pressionando e segurando o **botão esquerdo do mouse**.\n3. Solte o item soltando o **botão esquerdo do mouse**.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/wZNTSQr.gif)\n\n### Acessando versões alternativas de um elemento\n\n1.\tSelecione um elemento no menu **Elementos**.\n2. Pressione *SHIFT* ou *E*.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/jTCR3su.gif)\n\n> **Obs.:** Nem todos os elementos têm uma versão alternativa.\n\n### Alterando o tamanho das plataformas semi-sólidas\n\n1. Coloque o elemento semi-sólido em uma área vazia.\n2. Segure esse semi-sólido ao pressionar e segurar o **botão esquerdo do mouse**.\n3. Pressione e segure o **botão direito do mouse** também.\n4. Com os dois botões pressionados:\n\t- Pressione **seta para a esquerda ou direita** para diminuir e aumentar o **tamanho horizontal**.\n\t- Pressione **seta para cima ou para baixo** para diminuir e aumentar o **tamanho vertical**.\n5. Após alterar o tamanho, primeiro solte o **botão direito do mouse** e depois o **botão esquerdo** para colocar o elemento na área novamente.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/xH2QyCM.gif)\n\n> **Dica:** Você também pode usar as teclas WASD.\n\n##  Solução de Problemas\n\n### **Soluções gerais** \n\nOs seguintes passos podem evitar/resolver problemas comuns relacionados ao funcionamento geral do jogo:\n\n+ Vá até o arquivo ``.zip`` que você baixou contendo o jogo, clique com botão direito do mouse sobre o arquivo e vá em ``Propriedades``, marque a caixa ``Desbloquear`` e clique no botão **aplicar**, extraia o jogo novamente e então o execute como **administrador** se possível. Isso pode resolver problemas relacionadas a permissões.\n\n+ Evite armazenar o jogo e seus arquivos em diretórios com caracteres especiais (Ex.: ``â,Ñ,ç,&.``). Se você ainda estiver tendo algum problema com a inicialização do jogo, tente move-lo para o drive principal, geralmente ``C\\``.\n\n### Soluções específicas\n\n• **Não consigo salvar meu nível, o arquivo não aparece.**\n> Por razões desconhecidas, não é possível salvar os níveis no mesmo diretório do jogo, você pode tentar salvar em um diretório diferente. É sempre recomendável executar o jogo como administrador.\n\n• **Não consigo carregar meu nível, ele está incompleto / totalmente vazio.**\n> O arquivo não foi gerado corretamente, algo pode ter interrompido o processo de exportação, geralmente quando o jogo é fechado durante o processo de salvamento ou aparece algum fatal error. Não há como recuperá-lo.\n\n• **As músicas não estão tocando.**\n> Tente mover o diretório do jogo para um local mais curto. Se estiver em um driver diferente, tente movê-lo para o principal (geralmente ``C:\\``).\n\n• **Estou tendo problemas de desempenho.**\n> Tente alterar as configurações gráficas no jogo: defina **vsync** para ``LIG. (Alt.)`` ou defina **process. gráfico** para ``Normal``. Se o problema for com um nível específico, verifique o tamanho dos arquivos de customização, essa pode ser a causa.\n\n• **Não consigo alterar a ligação das teclas.**\n> No 1.S, não é possível, no entanto, você pode usar gamepads compatíveis com *DirectInput* ou *Xinput* ativando-o no menu de configurações.\n\n• **Estou usando um gamepad, mas o mapeamento de botões não funciona como o esperado.**\n> Nesse caso, eu recomendo usar um software terceiro para mapear os controles, você pode tentar algo como [antimicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro).\n\n## Perguntas e Respostas\n\n• **Por que não posso usar warp pipes/canos?**\n> A atual beta não oferece suporte para múltiplas sub-áreas, por enquanto os canos podem ser usados como decoração, assim como alguns outros recursos que ainda estão em fase beta.\n\n• **Onde posso compartilhar meus níveis com outras pessoas?**\n> No servidor oficial no [Discord](https://discord.me/marionetwork) ou em qualquer outro local de sua escolha. Você também pode compartilhar seus temas!\n\n• **Como criar e usar temas customizados?**\n> Role para baixo até a seção **Guia de Customização**.\n\n• **Como faço para compartilhar meu nível se eu usar alguma customização?**\n> Da mesma maneira que você faria normalmente, a única diferença é que você deve compartilhar os arquivos de customização juntamente ao arquivo do nível, você pode fazer isso facilmente colocando tudo em um único arquivo ``.zip``.\n\n• **Por que algumas partes das customizações parecem não ser utilizadas?**\n> As customizações são projetadas para serem compatíveis com novos recursos que estarão disponíveis em futuras versões.\n\n• **Qual é a diferença entre a versão atual e anteriores?**\n> O UniMaker 1.S (versão 1.2) possui essencialmente melhorias de desempenho, temas e efeitos melhorados, suporte para customizações e no geral uma experiência mais estável. 1.S é compatível com todos os níveis criados com versões anteriores. Este é o último open beta disponível no momento.\n\n• **O jogo receberá novas atualizações?**\n>  A versão 2.0 é a a próxima atualização que ainda está em desenvolvimento, contara com vários novos recursos, como: Novos inimigos e itens. Gráficos e trilha sonora completamente renovados. Novo criador de níveis. Você pode encontrar o devlog no meu servidor no [Discord](https://invite.gg/ninstar).\n\n• **A próxima versão já é jogável?**\n> Ainda não há nenhuma beta aberto jogável, a beta atualmente disponível é a versão 1.2. **Obs.:** Versão 2.0 não tem data de lançamento definida.\n\n• **Existe uma versão mobile?** (Android, iOS)\n> Não oficialmente, e não tenho planos de fazer uma devido a limitações técnicas, tanto o UniMaker 1.S têm funções essenciais limitadas aos desktops.\n\n• **⚠  Como apago meu registro de pontuação e níveis jogados?**\n> Primeiro feche o UniMaker e abra o explorador de arquivos, na barra de endereço, digite: ``%localappdata%\\UniMaker`` e em seguida, exclua ``settings.ini``.\n\n# Guia de Customização\n\n## Primeiros Passos\n\nPrimeiro, você deve procurar uma base, na pasta ``/Courses/[Customization Example]`` existem três modelos diferentes que você pode usar:\n\n- **Simple** [Recomendado]\n- **Layers, Parallax & Particles**\n- **Animations**\n\nApós escolher um modelo, modifique todos os recursos que desejar com um editor de imagens (para sprites) e um editor de áudio (para músicas) de sua escolha.\n\nAqui estão algumas recomendações que você deve levar em consideração:\n\n1. O UniMaker usa **animações baseadas em faixas** (Strip), portanto, para todas as animações, cada quadro fica ao lado do outro em um único arquivo.\n\t- Se você estiver usando Aseprite para fazer seus sprites, você pode exportar suas animações no formato correto indo até ``File`` > ``Export Sprite Sheet`` e então alterando ``Sheet Type`` para ``Horizontal Strip``.\n2. **Não exceda os limites do sprite**, exceto plano de fundo e camadas de efeitos.\n3. **Você pode definir qualquer tamanho para o plano de fundo**, mas lembre-se de que isso pode afetar o desempenho para você e outras pessoas, o mesmo se aplica a sprites com muitos quadros de animação.\n4. **Todos os sprites devem ter um canal alpha** para transparência, não é possível usar as cores chaves para serem removidas automaticamente (por exemplo: verde ou magenta).\n5. **Todos os arquivos de música devem estar em** ``.ogg`` (*Vorbis*), este é o único\nformato que o motor do UniMaker aceita.\n\t- Eu recomendo usar o [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) para exportar para este formato.\n\n## Referência\n\nAqui está uma lista do conteúdo de cada arquivo de configuração e como usar seus parâmetros.\n\n### ``uni_scenery.txt``\n\n• **Base do arquivo**\n```ini\n[UNI_SCENERY]\nunderwater = 0\ncolor_grid = 0\n\nsprsheet_frames = 1\nsprsheet_anim = 0\nbg_frames = 1\nbg_anim = 0\n\nbg_color_r = 255\nbg_color_g = 255\nbg_color_b = 255\n\nbg_camfixed = 0\nbg_parallax_h = 1\nbg_parallax_v = 0\nbg_range_h = 0\nbg_range_v = 0\nbg_tiled_h = 1\nbg_tiled_v = 1\nbg_offset_h = 0\nbg_offset_v = 0\nbg_scroll_h = 0\nbg_scroll_v = 0\n\nemitter_type = 0\nemitter_intensity = 0\n```\n\n• **Descrição dos parâmetros**\n\n**underwater** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-|\n|``0``|Sem água/lava.\n|``1``|A área é preenchida por água.\n|``2``|A área é parcialmente coberta por água.\n|``3``|A área é parcialmente coberta por lava.\n\n**color_grid** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-\n|``0``|Preto, recomendado para fundos mais claros.\n|``1``|Branco, recomendado para fundos mais escuros.\n\n**sprsheet_frames** = ...  \n**bg_frames** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-\n|``Qualquer valor``| A quantidade de quadros para animar.\n\n**sprsheet_anim** = ...  \n**bg_anim** = ...\n|Estado|Resultado\n|-|-\n|``Qualquer valor``| O intervalo de tempo em que a animação avança um quadro (em quadros).\n> Como o jogo é executado a 60 quadros por segundo, se você o definir como ``60`` ele avançará 1 quadro a cada segundo, o mesmo se você o definir como ``120`` para avançar 1 quadro a cada 2 segundos ou ``30`` para avançar 2 quadros por segundo.

You can use it as a preview when sharing your course.\n\n### 🌐 Loading courses from the internet\n\nWhen loading courses, you can easily import them directly from the internet:\n\n1. Select the option to open a course as you normally would do.\n2. Search for the course you want to play (must be in ``.uni``or ``.unis``) and copy its URL.\n3. Paste it in the **name** bar, then select **open** and wait until the course is automatically downloaded and started.\n\n> **Note:** This will not work with courses packed in ``.zip``.\n\n####\n\n### Erasing / placing elements in the course\n\n- <img alt=\"place\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Fagzu3F.png\" width=\"16\"> **Place**\n\t1. Select an element in the **Course Elements** menu.\n\t2. In your course, **left click** to place the selected element in an empty area.\n- <img alt=\"erase\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nWj0ZJU.png\" width=\"16\"> **Erase**\n\t1. Hover over some element in the course.\n\t2. **Right click** to erase that element.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/7zcJYXb.gif)\n\n> **Tip:** You can erase or place multiple elements by holding one of buttons. You can clear your current selection by clicking on the **eraser** <img alt=\"eraser\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7NZwbYi.png\" width=\"24\"> icon.\n\n### Placing items inside blocks\n\n1.\tPlace an item and a block in an empty area apart from each other.\n2.\tDrag the item over the block by pressing and holding the **left mouse button**.\n3.\tThen drop the item by releasing the **left button**.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/wZNTSQr.gif)\n\n### Accessing alternative versions of an element\n\n1.\tSelect an element in the **Course Elements** menu.\n2.\tPress *SHIFT* or *E*.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/jTCR3su.gif)\n\n> **Note:** Not all elements have an alternative version.\n\n### Changing the size of semi-solid platforms\n\n1.\tPlace the semi-solid element in an empty area.\n2.\tHold this semi-solid by pressing and holding the **left mouse button**.\n3.\tThen press and hold the **right mouse button** as well.\n4.\tWith both buttons held:\n\t- Press **left or right** to decrease or increase the **horizontal size**.\n\t- Press **up or down** to decrease or increase the **vertical size**.\n5.\tAfter changing the size, first release the **right mouse button** and then the **left button** to place the element on the area again.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/xH2QyCM.gif)\n\n> **Tip:** You can also use the WASD keys instead of arrow keys.\n\n##  Troubleshooting\n\n### General solutions\n\nThe following steps can avoid/solve common problems regarding the overall functionality of the game:\n\n+ Go to the ``.zip`` file you downloaded containing the game, right-click on it and go to ``Properties``, check the ``Unblock`` box and click on the **apply** button, extract the game again and then, if possible, run it as **administrator**. This can solve problems regarding permissions.\n\n+ Avoid storing the game and its files in directories with special characters in their names (E.g.: ``â,Ñ,ç,&.``). If you are still having trouble when starting the game, try moving it to the main drive, usually ``C\\``.\n\n### Specific solutions\n\n• **I can't save my course, the file does not appear.**\n> For unknown reasons it is not possible to save courses in the same directory as the game, you can try saving in a different directory; it's always recommended to run the game as administrator.\n\n• **I can't load my course, it's incomplete / totally empty.**\n> The file wasn't properly generated, something may have interrupted the exporting step, usually when the game is closed during the save process or some fatal error shows up. There is no way to recover it.\n\n• **Songs won't play.**\n> Try moving the game directory to a shorter location. If it's on a different driver, try moving it to the main one (usually ``C:\\``)\n\n• **I'm having performance issues.**\n> Try changing the graphics settings in the game: set **vsync** to ``ON (Alt.)`` or set **graphic processing** to ``Normal``, If the problem is with a specific level, check the size of the customization files, this may be the cause.\n\n• **I can't change the key binding.**\n> In 1.S it is not possible, however you can use gamepads compatible with *DirectInput* or *Xinput* by enabling it on settings menu.\n\n• **I'm using a gamepad, but the button mapping doesn't work as expected.**\n> In that case I highly recommend using a third party software for mapping the controls, you can try something like [antimicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro).\n\n## Questions and Answers\n\n• **Why can't I use warp pipes?**\n> The current beta does not support multiples sub-areas, this will be implemented in upcoming versions, for now pipes can be used as decorations, as well as some other features that are still in beta stage.\n\n• **Where can I share my courses with other people?**\n> In the official [Discord](https://discord.me/marionetwork) server or any other place of your choice. You can also share your themes!\n\n• **How do I create and use custom themes?**\n> Scroll down and read the **Customization Guide** section.\n\n• **How do I share my course if I use customizations?**\n> Just as you would normally do, the only difference is that you must share the customizations files alongside your course file, you can do this easily by putting everything in a single ``.zip`` file.\n\n• **Why some parts of the customizations seem to be unused?**\n> Customizations are designed to be compatible with new features that will be available in upcoming versions.\n\n• **What is the difference between the current and the previous versions?**\n> UniMaker 1.S (version 1.2) essentially has performance improvements, revamped themes and effects, support for customizations and a more stable experience in general. 1.S is compatible with all courses created with previous versions. This is the latest open-beta available at the moment.\n\n• **Will this game receive new updates?**\n> Version 2.0 is the upcoming version that is still under development with tons of new features such as: New enemies and items. Completely revamped graphics and soundtrack. Brand new course maker. You can find the devlog on my [Discord](https://invite.gg/ninstar) server.\n\n• **Is the new version already playable?**\n> It does not have any playable open beta yet, the currently available beta is version 1.2. **Note:** Version 2.0 has no defined release date.\n\n• **Is there a mobile version?** (I.e.: Android, iOS)\n> Not officially, and I do not have plans on making one due to technical limitations, both UniMaker 1.S and UniMaker DX have essential functions that are limited to desktops.\n\n• **⚠  How do I erase my score record and courses played?**\n> First close UniMaker, then open you file explorer, in the address bar type: ``%localappdata%\\UniMaker`` and then delete the ``settings.ini``.\n\n# Customization Guide\n\n## First Steps\n\nFirst, you should look for a base, on ``/Courses/[Customization Example]`` folder there are 3 different custom templates that you can use:  \n\n- **Simple** [Recommended]\n- **Layers, Parallax & Particles**\n- **Animations**\n\nAfter choosing a template, modify any assets you want with an image editor (for sprites) and audio editor (for songs) of your choice.\n\nHere are some recommendations that you should take into account:\n\n1. UniMaker uses **strip-based animations**, so for all animations, each frame is next to each other in a single file.\n\t- If you are using Aseprite to make your sprites, you can export your animations in the correct format by going to ``File`` > ``Export Sprite Sheet`` and then changing the ``Sheet Type`` to ``Horizontal Strip``.\n2.\t**Don't exceed the sprite's limits**, except the background and effect layers.\n3.\t**You can set any size for the background**, but keep in mind that this can impact the performance for you and other people, the same applies to sprites with too many animation frames.\n4.\t**All sprites must have an alpha channel** (transparency), you can not use key colors to be automatically removed (E.g.: green or magenta).\n5.\t**All song files should be in** ``.ogg`` (*Vorbis*), this the only \nformat that UniMaker's engine accepts.\n\t- I recommend using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for exporting in this format.\n\n## Reference\n\nHere is a list of the content of each configuration file and how to use its parameters.\n\n### ``uni_scenery.txt``\n\n• **Base file**\n```ini\n[UNI_SCENERY]\nunderwater = 0\ncolor_grid = 0\n\nsprsheet_frames = 1\nsprsheet_anim = 0\nbg_frames = 1\nbg_anim = 0\n\nbg_color_r = 255\nbg_color_g = 255\nbg_color_b = 255\n\nbg_camfixed = 0\nbg_parallax_h = 1\nbg_parallax_v = 0\nbg_range_h = 0\nbg_range_v = 0\nbg_tiled_h = 1\nbg_tiled_v = 1\nbg_offset_h = 0\nbg_offset_v = 0\nbg_scroll_h = 0\nbg_scroll_v = 0\n\nemitter_type = 0\nemitter_intensity = 0\n```\n\n• **Parameters description**\n\n**underwater** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``0``|No water/lava.\n|``1``|The area is filled by water.\n|``2``|The area is partially covered by water.\n|``3``|The area is partially covered by lava.\n\n**color_grid** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``0``|Black, recommended for lighter backgrounds.\n|``1``|White, recommended for darker backgrounds.\n\n**sprsheet_frames** = ...  \n**bg_frames** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``Any value``| The amount of frames to animate.\n\n**sprsheet_anim** = ...  \n**bg_anim** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``Any value``|The time interval in which the animation advance one frame (in frames).\n> Since the game runs at 60 frames per second, If you set it to ``60``, it will advance 1 frame every second, the same if you set it to ``120`` to advance 1 frame every 2 seconds or ``30`` to advance 2 frames every second.

Paste it in the **name** bar, then select **open** and wait until the course is automatically downloaded and started.\n\n> **Note:** This will not work with courses packed in ``.zip``.\n\n####\n\n### Erasing / placing elements in the course\n\n- <img alt=\"place\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Fagzu3F.png\" width=\"16\"> **Place**\n\t1. Select an element in the **Course Elements** menu.\n\t2. In your course, **left click** to place the selected element in an empty area.\n- <img alt=\"erase\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nWj0ZJU.png\" width=\"16\"> **Erase**\n\t1. Hover over some element in the course.\n\t2. **Right click** to erase that element.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/7zcJYXb.gif)\n\n> **Tip:** You can erase or place multiple elements by holding one of buttons. You can clear your current selection by clicking on the **eraser** <img alt=\"eraser\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7NZwbYi.png\" width=\"24\"> icon.\n\n### Placing items inside blocks\n\n1.\tPlace an item and a block in an empty area apart from each other.\n2.\tDrag the item over the block by pressing and holding the **left mouse button**.\n3.\tThen drop the item by releasing the **left button**.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/wZNTSQr.gif)\n\n### Accessing alternative versions of an element\n\n1.\tSelect an element in the **Course Elements** menu.\n2.\tPress *SHIFT* or *E*.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/jTCR3su.gif)\n\n> **Note:** Not all elements have an alternative version.\n\n### Changing the size of semi-solid platforms\n\n1.\tPlace the semi-solid element in an empty area.\n2.\tHold this semi-solid by pressing and holding the **left mouse button**.\n3.\tThen press and hold the **right mouse button** as well.\n4.\tWith both buttons held:\n\t- Press **left or right** to decrease or increase the **horizontal size**.\n\t- Press **up or down** to decrease or increase the **vertical size**.\n5.\tAfter changing the size, first release the **right mouse button** and then the **left button** to place the element on the area again.\n\n![Reproduction](https://i.imgur.com/xH2QyCM.gif)\n\n> **Tip:** You can also use the WASD keys instead of arrow keys.\n\n##  Troubleshooting\n\n### General solutions\n\nThe following steps can avoid/solve common problems regarding the overall functionality of the game:\n\n+ Go to the ``.zip`` file you downloaded containing the game, right-click on it and go to ``Properties``, check the ``Unblock`` box and click on the **apply** button, extract the game again and then, if possible, run it as **administrator**. This can solve problems regarding permissions.\n\n+ Avoid storing the game and its files in directories with special characters in their names (E.g.: ``â,Ñ,ç,&.``). If you are still having trouble when starting the game, try moving it to the main drive, usually ``C\\``.\n\n### Specific solutions\n\n• **I can't save my course, the file does not appear.**\n> For unknown reasons it is not possible to save courses in the same directory as the game, you can try saving in a different directory; it's always recommended to run the game as administrator.\n\n• **I can't load my course, it's incomplete / totally empty.**\n> The file wasn't properly generated, something may have interrupted the exporting step, usually when the game is closed during the save process or some fatal error shows up. There is no way to recover it.\n\n• **Songs won't play.**\n> Try moving the game directory to a shorter location. If it's on a different driver, try moving it to the main one (usually ``C:\\``)\n\n• **I'm having performance issues.**\n> Try changing the graphics settings in the game: set **vsync** to ``ON (Alt.)`` or set **graphic processing** to ``Normal``, If the problem is with a specific level, check the size of the customization files, this may be the cause.\n\n• **I can't change the key binding.**\n> In 1.S it is not possible, however you can use gamepads compatible with *DirectInput* or *Xinput* by enabling it on settings menu.\n\n• **I'm using a gamepad, but the button mapping doesn't work as expected.**\n> In that case I highly recommend using a third party software for mapping the controls, you can try something like [antimicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro).\n\n## Questions and Answers\n\n• **Why can't I use warp pipes?**\n> The current beta does not support multiples sub-areas, this will be implemented in upcoming versions, for now pipes can be used as decorations, as well as some other features that are still in beta stage.\n\n• **Where can I share my courses with other people?**\n> In the official [Discord](https://discord.me/marionetwork) server or any other place of your choice. You can also share your themes!\n\n• **How do I create and use custom themes?**\n> Scroll down and read the **Customization Guide** section.\n\n• **How do I share my course if I use customizations?**\n> Just as you would normally do, the only difference is that you must share the customizations files alongside your course file, you can do this easily by putting everything in a single ``.zip`` file.\n\n• **Why some parts of the customizations seem to be unused?**\n> Customizations are designed to be compatible with new features that will be available in upcoming versions.\n\n• **What is the difference between the current and the previous versions?**\n> UniMaker 1.S (version 1.2) essentially has performance improvements, revamped themes and effects, support for customizations and a more stable experience in general. 1.S is compatible with all courses created with previous versions. This is the latest open-beta available at the moment.\n\n• **Will this game receive new updates?**\n> UniMaker DX (version 2.0) is the upcoming version that is still under development with tons of new features such as:\n> \n> • New enemies and items.\n> • Completely revamped graphics and soundtrack.\nBrand new course maker.\n>\n> You can find the devlog on my [Discord](https://invite.gg/ninstar) server.\n\n• **Is the new version already playable?**\n> It does not have any playable open beta yet, the currently available beta is version 1.2. **Note:** Version 2.0 has no defined release date.\n\n• **Is there a mobile version?** (I.e.: Android, iOS)\n> Not officially, and I do not have plans on making one due to technical limitations, both UniMaker 1.S and UniMaker DX have essential functions that are limited to desktops.\n\n• **⚠  How do I erase my score record and courses played?**\n> First close UniMaker, then open you file explorer, in the address bar type: ``%localappdata%\\UniMaker`` and then delete the ``settings.ini``.\n\n# Customization Guide\n\n## First Steps\n\nFirst, you should look for a base, on ``/Courses/[Customization Example]`` folder there are 3 different custom templates that you can use:  \n\n- **Simple** [Recommended]\n- **Layers, Parallax & Particles**\n- **Animations**\n\nAfter choosing a template, modify any assets you want with an image editor (for sprites) and audio editor (for songs) of your choice.\n\nHere are some recommendations that you should take into account:\n\n1. UniMaker uses **strip-based animations**, so for all animations, each frame is next to each other in a single file.\n\t- If you are using Aseprite to make your sprites, you can export your animations in the correct format by going to ``File`` > ``Export Sprite Sheet`` and then changing the ``Sheet Type`` to ``Horizontal Strip``.\n2.\t**Don't exceed the sprite's limits**, except the background and effect layers.\n3.\t**You can set any size for the background**, but keep in mind that this can impact the performance for you and other people, the same applies to sprites with too many animation frames.\n4.\t**All sprites must have an alpha channel** (transparency), you can not use key colors to be automatically removed (E.g.: green or magenta).\n5.\t**All song files should be in** ``.ogg`` (*Vorbis*), this the only \nformat that UniMaker's engine accepts.\n\t- I recommend using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for exporting in this format.\n\n## Reference\n\nHere is a list of the content of each configuration file and how to use its parameters.\n\n### ``uni_scenery.txt``\n\n• **Base file**\n```ini\n[UNI_SCENERY]\nunderwater = 0\ncolor_grid = 0\n\nsprsheet_frames = 1\nsprsheet_anim = 0\nbg_frames = 1\nbg_anim = 0\n\nbg_color_r = 255\nbg_color_g = 255\nbg_color_b = 255\n\nbg_camfixed = 0\nbg_parallax_h = 1\nbg_parallax_v = 0\nbg_range_h = 0\nbg_range_v = 0\nbg_tiled_h = 1\nbg_tiled_v = 1\nbg_offset_h = 0\nbg_offset_v = 0\nbg_scroll_h = 0\nbg_scroll_v = 0\n\nemitter_type = 0\nemitter_intensity = 0\n```\n\n• **Parameters description**\n\n**underwater** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``0``|No water/lava.\n|``1``|The area is filled by water.\n|``2``|The area is partially covered by water.\n|``3``|The area is partially covered by lava.\n\n**color_grid** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``0``|Black, recommended for lighter backgrounds.\n|``1``|White, recommended for darker backgrounds.\n\n**sprsheet_frames** = ...  \n**bg_frames** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``Any value``| The amount of frames to animate.\n\n**sprsheet_anim** = ...  \n**bg_anim** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``Any value``|The time interval in which the animation advance one frame (in frames).\n> Since the game runs at 60 frames per second, If you set it to ``60``, it will advance 1 frame every second, the same if you set it to ``120`` to advance 1 frame every 2 seconds or ``30`` to advance 2 frames every second.

Download the repository.\n\t2. Select the ``.zip`` file containing the version you want to compile.\n\t3. Extract the ``.zip`` file.\n\t4. Open the extracted ``.project.gmx`` file as a project.\n\t5. Go into **File** > **Create Executable**.\n\n> **Note:** Since these projects were written with GameMaker: Studio 1.4 when importing to GameMaker Studio 2 you will probably have to manually make some adjustments in order to compile it properly, such as converting some strings to real values and vice versa.\n\n## Importing Songs\n\nDue to copyright reasons, none of the source codes contain songs in their package, but you can extract them from compiled releases, follow these steps:\n\n1. Download the compiled executable.\n2. Go to the ``UniMaker`` subfolder (where the executable is located) and then copy all the ``.ogg`` files.\n3. Open your project in GameMaker Studio, go to ``Included Files`` folder visible in the resource tree, then import all the files that have been copied.\n4.

UniMaker uses **strip-based animations**, so for all animations, each frame is next to each other in a single file.\n\t- If you are using Aseprite to make your sprites, you can export your animations in the correct format by going to ``File`` > ``Export Sprite Sheet`` and then changing the ``Sheet Type`` to ``Horizontal Strip``.\n2.\t**Don't exceed the sprite's limits**, except the background and effect layers.\n3.\t**You can set any size for the background**, but keep in mind that this can impact the performance for you and other people, the same applies to sprites with too many animation frames.\n4.\t**All sprites must have an alpha channel** (transparency), you can not use key colors to be automatically removed (E.g.: green or magenta).\n5.\t**All song files should be in** ``.ogg`` (*Vorbis*), this the only \nformat that UniMaker's engine accepts.\n\t- I recommend using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for exporting in this format.\n\n## Reference\n\nHere is a list of the content of each configuration file and how to use its parameters.\n\n### ``uni_scenery.txt``\n\n• **Base file**\n```ini\n[UNI_SCENERY]\nunderwater = 0\ncolor_grid = 0\n\nsprsheet_frames = 1\nsprsheet_anim = 0\nbg_frames = 1\nbg_anim = 0\n\nbg_color_r = 255\nbg_color_g = 255\nbg_color_b = 255\n\nbg_camfixed = 0\nbg_parallax_h = 1\nbg_parallax_v = 0\nbg_range_h = 0\nbg_range_v = 0\nbg_tiled_h = 1\nbg_tiled_v = 1\nbg_offset_h = 0\nbg_offset_v = 0\nbg_scroll_h = 0\nbg_scroll_v = 0\n\nemitter_type = 0\nemitter_intensity = 0\n```\n\n• **Parameters description**\n\n**underwater** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-|\n|``0``|No water/lava.\n|``1``|The area is filled by water.\n|``2``|The area is partially covered by water.\n|``3``|The area is partially covered by lava.\n\n**color_grid** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``0``|Black, recommended for lighter backgrounds.\n|``1``|White, recommended for darker backgrounds.\n\n**sprsheet_frames** = ...  \n**bg_frames** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``Any value``| The amount of frames to animate.\n\n**sprsheet_anim** = ...  \n**bg_anim** = ...\n|State|Result\n|-|-\n|``Any value``|The time interval in which the animation advance one frame (in frames).\n> Since the game runs at 60 frames per second, If you set it to ``60``, it will advance 1 frame every second, the same if you set it to ``120`` to advance 1 frame every 2 seconds or ``30`` to advance 2 frames every second.

Download the repository.\n\t2. Select the ``.zip`` file containing the version you want to compile.\n\t3. Extract the ``.zip`` file.\n\t4. Open the extracted ``.project.gmx`` file as a project.\n\t5. Go into **File** > **Create Executable**.\n\n> **Note:** Since these projects were written with GameMaker: Studio 1.4 when importing to GameMaker Studio 2 you will probably have to manually make some adjustments in order to compile it properly, such as converting some strings to real values and vice versa.\n\n## Importing Songs\n\nDue to copyright reasons, none of the source codes contain songs in their package, but you can extract them from compiled releases, follow these steps:\n\n1. Download the compiled executable.\n2. Go to the ``UniMaker`` subfolder (where the executable is located) and then copy all the ``.ogg`` files.\n3. Open your project in GameMaker Studio, go to ``Included Files`` folder visible in the resource tree, then import all the files that have been copied.\n4. Compile the project and voilà!\n","properties":"\n","discussions":{},"comments":{},"hash":-354988827}},"syncHistory":{"main":[-354988827,-280634804,-354988827]},"v":1,"hash":1611462433808,"tx":1688},"jaxNvVWiTC3SP5sM/contentState":{"id":"jaxNvVWiTC3SP5sM/contentState","type":"contentState","selectionStart":0,"selectionEnd":408,"scrollPosition":{"sectionIdx":0,"posInSection":0},"hash":1611462435061,"tx":1691},"iiMXpj5Rm2Q05IrU/contentState":{"id":"iiMXpj5Rm2Q05IrU/contentState","type":"contentState","selectionStart":0,"selectionEnd":16561,"scrollPosition":{"sectionIdx":76,"posInSection":0.9642857142857143},"hash":1611462446425,"tx":1694},"yAeNOM8FWkZCbBf2/syncedContent":{"id":"yAeNOM8FWkZCbBf2/syncedContent","type":"syncedContent","historyData":{"1096723443":{"id":"yAeNOM8FWkZCbBf2/content","type":"content","text":"<img alt=\"Card\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UDyoxXf.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n**UniMaker • Manual** // Versão: ``1.2``\n\n1.
